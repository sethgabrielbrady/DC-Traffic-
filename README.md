FRONT END


We have been given some data by the DC government on traffic citations given in various months of 2016. Our software development agency has been asked to provide some analysis of this data. They would also like for us to make our code extensible so that we can further analyze data as necessary without having to redo all of the work again. They have asked us to write the program in Node.js and to use separate modules for the various pieces of the solution.
